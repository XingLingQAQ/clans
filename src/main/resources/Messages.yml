      # Clans Pro Example:
      #
      # Clan clan = instance;
      # Clan.Color palette = clan.getPalette();
      #
      # The above text is what the api usage would look like but this stuff lets you act like your doing it using bukkit like '.' node separation.
      #
      #      Now to pull colors from the palette that you could use below in an allowed circumstance;
      #        getPalette.toGradient.getStart (Starting hex)
      #        getPalette.toGradient.getEnd (Ending hex)
      #
      # Labyrinth DefaultColor Example:
      #
      # DefaultColor color = DefaultColor.MANGO;
      # String name = color.getName();
      #
      #      Now to pull colors codes directly you could use the already configured section below.
      #
      # Following basic common sense and wiki available api knowledge you have access to many results.
