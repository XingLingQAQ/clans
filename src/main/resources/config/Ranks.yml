# NOTE: When renaming a rank, make sure you put an "old-name:" value with the old name next to it so the application has a way to smoothly transition players ranks automagically.
#
# An example can be found below:
#
# Say we wanted to rename Owner to Mayor
# # # # # # # # # # # #
# HIGHEST:
#   name: 'Mayor'
#   old-name: 'Owner'
#   sy...
#   .....
# # # # # # # # # # # #
# Now when we start our server or reload all users that were once apart-
# of the "Owner" rank will now be in the "Mayor" rank.
